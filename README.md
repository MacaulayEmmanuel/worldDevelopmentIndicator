# World Development Indicators SQL Project

This SQL project uses the World Development Indicators dataset from Kaggle to answer some interesting questions related to global development. The dataset contains thousands of data points covering areas from agriculture and industry to trade and access to clean water. The data is available as one database file (sqlite), which can be accessed using the sqlite3 extension in VS Code.

# Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to have the following:

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed
- sqlite3 extension installed in VS Code
- World Development Indicators dataset (indicators.sqlite) downloaded from Kaggle

# Getting Started

- Download the World Development Indicators dataset (indicators.sqlite) from Kaggle.
- Clone or download the project from this repository.
- Open the project folder in VS Code.
- Open the indicators.sqlite file in the sqlite3 extension.
- Write SQL queries in the extension's terminal to answer the questions of interest.

# Examples

Here are some examples of questions you can answer with this dataset:

- Did access to clean water in urban and rural populations in different world regions increase or decrease over the last decades?
- How did the area of arable land change? Did it have any impact on child employment in agriculture?
- Do CO2 emissions increase with industry development?

To answer these questions, you can write SQL queries in the sqlite3 extension's terminal to filter for the relevant indicators and group the data as necessary.
